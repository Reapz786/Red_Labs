## **How to Learn Exploit Execution**

Here's the systematic approach:

### **Step 1: Read Before Running**

- Open the exploit in a text editor
- Identify:
    - What vulnerability it targets
    - What it sends to the server
    - What it expects back
    - What parameters you need to provide

### **Step 2: Understand the Attack Flow**

- Does it:
    - Send a malicious payload in a URL parameter?
    - Upload a file?
    - Abuse a deserialization flaw?
- Map this to the vulnerability class (RCE, SQLi, file upload, etc.)

### **Step 3: Test Execution**

- Run the exploit **without** a reverse shell first
- Use a harmless command like `whoami` or `id`
- Verify it works before escalating to a shell

### **Step 4: Adapt for Reverse Shells**

- Once you confirm RCE, modify the payload to:
    - Call back to your listener
    - Use bash, nc, Python, or PHP reverse shell syntax
    - URL-encode if needed

## **THM Rooms to Close This Gap**

You need **exploit adaptation practice**. These rooms will help:

| Room                | Focus                        | Why It Matters                               |

| **Vulnversity**     | File upload + manual exploit | Teaches upload restrictions & shell delivery |
| **CC: Pen Testing** | Manual exploit modification  | Forces you to read and adapt public exploits |
| **Inclusion**       | RCE via LFI/RFI              | Different RCE vector, same adaptation skill  |
The skill you're building is:

1. **Code literacy** — read exploits like a developer
2. **Attack flow mapping** — understand vulnerability → payload → shell
3. **Payload adaptation** — turn PoC into working shell delivery
